  runtime:
    # Use this for the regular shutdown of all inference runtimes.
    # e.g., during weekends or nighttime.
    # NOTE: This feature runs once for each given scheduled time. Hence,
    # if dynamic-model-loading (server side feature) or autoscaler
    # is enabled, new runtime will be created or scale up even during
    # the shutdown period.
    scheduledShutdown:
      # Specify whether to create a CronJob for shutdown.
      # If enable, The CronJob scales up/down all runtime StatefulSets
      # at the specified time. At scaling-up, the number of replicas
      # will be `.model.default.replicas`

      # The shutdown schedule.
